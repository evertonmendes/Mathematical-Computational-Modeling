# Mathematical-Computational-Modeling


Here are my Projects in this class, such as my code and my reports.

I'll explain the "Mathematical-Computational-Modeling" repository. As the name implies, the most used mathematical methods for the study of data are studied. For a better understanding of what was studied, I will put the projects and their main objectives below:

-Project One: Linear Least Squares (linear, quadratic, cubic, plane surface, quadratic surface.

-Project Two: Minimum of a Scalar Field using Random Search, Gradient Descent and Simulated Anneling.
-Project Three: Direction Field and Euler Method with Malthusian, Logistic and Lotka-Volterra equations.
-Project Four: Harmonic Signals and Filters (highpass, lowpass, bandpass, Gausian.
-Project Five: solve the traveling salesman problem using a genetic algorithm
-Project Seven: Direction Diffusion Equation of Gray-Scott
